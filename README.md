# bls2brs

Convert Blockland saves (bls) to [Brickadia] saves (brs).

## Download

Executables for Linux and Windows can be found on [the Releases page].

## Usage

Drag `.bls` files onto the executable to create corresponding `.brs` files next to them.

Not all Blockland bricks are supported, but the converter tries its best to support many variants.

## Contributing

Pull requests are appreciated. If you encounter missing bricks, update `src/mappings.rs`.
